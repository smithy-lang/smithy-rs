Enable retries by default for AWS SDK clients using `BehaviorVersion::v2026_01_12()` or later.

Previously, retries were only enabled when constructing clients via `aws_config::load_from_env()`. Clients constructed directly using `Client::from_conf()` did not have retries enabled, which was inconsistent with AWS SDK behavior in other languages.

This change affects AWS SDK clients constructed with `Client::from_conf()` when using `BehaviorVersion::v2026_01_12()` or `BehaviorVersion::latest()`. Generic Smithy clients (non-AWS) are not affected.

To disable retries:
```rust
let config = aws_sdk_s3::Config::builder()
    .retry_config(RetryConfig::disabled())
    // ...
    .build();
```
