Add `expect_number_as_string_or_null` function to `aws-smithy-json` that extracts JSON numbers as strings without converting to u64/i64/f64. This preserves arbitrary precision for BigInteger and BigDecimal support, preventing precision loss for numbers larger than standard numeric types can represent.
