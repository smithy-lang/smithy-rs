Automatically add `smithy.framework#ValidationException` to operations with constrained inputs. Previously, users had to either set `addValidationExceptionToConstrainedOperations: true` in codegen settings or manually add `ValidationException` to each operation. Now this happens automatically unless a custom validation exception (a structure with the `@validationException` trait) is defined in the model. When using a custom validation exception, users must explicitly add it to each applicable operation. The `addValidationExceptionToConstrainedOperations` flag is deprecated.
