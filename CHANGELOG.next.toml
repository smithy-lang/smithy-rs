message = "It's now possible to nest runtime components with the `RuntimePlugin` trait. A `current_components` argument was added to the `runtime_components` method so that components configured from previous runtime plugins can be referenced in the current runtime plugin. Ordering of runtime plugins was also introduced via a new `RuntimePlugin::order` method."

message = """Several breaking changes were made to the aws-sigv4 API to remove the direct HTTP dependency:
- The `take_parameters` and `take_headers` APIs were removed from `SigningInstructions`. Use `into_parts()` instead
- The arguments of `SignableRequest::new` were changed to accept string types instead of types from the HTTP crate
- `SigningInstructions::apply_to_request` was gated beyond an `http0-compat` feature flag for backwards compatibility. This API MAY be removed in a future release.
- Several public accessors were removed from `SigningInstructions`.
