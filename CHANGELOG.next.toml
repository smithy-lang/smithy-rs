<details>
<summary>Breaking change in how event stream signing works (click to expand more details)</summary>

This change will only impact you if you are wiring up their own event stream signing/authentication scheme. If you're using `aws-sig-auth` to use AWS SigV4 event stream signing, then this change will **not** impact you.

Previously, event stream signing was configured at codegen time by placing a `new_event_stream_signer` method on the `Config`. This function was called at serialization time to connect the signer to the streaming body. Now, instead, a special `DeferredSigner` is wired up at serialization time that relies on a signing implementation to be sent on a channel by the HTTP request signer. To do this, a `DeferredSignerSender` must be pulled out of the property bag, and its `send()` method called with the desired event stream signing implementation.

See the changes in https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/pull/2671 for an example of how this was done for SigV4.

message = """The middleware system has been reworked as we push for a unified, simple, and consistent API. The following changes have been made in service of this goal:

- A `ServiceShape` trait has been added.
- The `Plugin` trait has been simplified.
- The `HttpMarker` and `ModelMarker` marker traits have been added to better distinguish when plugins run and what they have access to.
- The `Operation` structure has been removed.
- A `Scoped` `Plugin` has been added.

The `Plugin` trait has now been simplified and the `Operation` struct has been removed.

## Addition of `ServiceShape`

Since the [0.52 release](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/releases/tag/release-2022-12-12) the `OperationShape` has existed.

```rust
/// Models the [Smithy Operation shape].
///
/// [Smithy Operation shape]: https://awslabs.github.io/smithy/1.0/spec/core/model.html#operation
pub trait OperationShape {
    /// The ID of the operation.
    const ID: ShapeId;

    /// The operation input.
    type Input;
    /// The operation output.
    type Output;
    /// The operation error. [`Infallible`](std::convert::Infallible) in the case where no error
    /// exists.
    type Error;
}
```

This allowed `Plugin` authors to access these associated types and constants. See the [`PrintPlugin`](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/blob/main/examples/pokemon-service/src/plugin.rs) as an example.

We continue with this approach and introduce the following trait:

```rust
/// Models the [Smithy Service shape].
///
/// [Smithy Service shape]: https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/service-types.html
pub trait ServiceShape {
    /// The [`ShapeId`] of the service.
    const ID: ShapeId;

    /// The version of the service.
    const VERSION: Option<&'static str>;

    /// The [Protocol] applied to this service.
    ///
    /// [Protocol]: https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/protocol-traits.html
    type Protocol;

    /// An enumeration of all operations contained in this service.
    type Operations;
}
```

With the changes to `Plugin`, described below, middleware authors now have access to this information at compile time.

## Simplication of the `Plugin` trait

Previously,

```rust
trait Plugin<P, Op, S, L> {
    type Service;
    type Layer;

    fn map(&self, input: Operation<S, L>) -> Operation<Self::Service, Self::Layer>;
}
```

modified an `Operation`.

Now,

```rust
trait Plugin<Service, Operation, T> {
    type Output;

    fn apply(&self, input: T) -> Self::Output;
}
```

maps a `tower::Service` to a `tower::Service`. This is equivalent to `tower::Layer` with two extra type parameters: `Service` and `Operation`, which implement `ServiceShape` and `OperationShape` respectively.

Having both `Service` and `Operation` as type parameters also provides an even surface for advanced users to extend the codegenerator in a structured way. See [this issue](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/issues/2777) for more context.

The following middleware setup

```rust
pub struct PrintService<S> {
    inner: S,
    name: &'static str,
}

impl<R, S> Service<R> for PrintService<S>
where
    S: Service<R>,
{
    async fn call(&mut self, req: R) -> Self::Future {
        println!("Hi {}", self.name);
        self.inner.call(req)
    }
}

pub struct PrintLayer {
    name: &'static str,
}

impl<S> Layer<S> for PrintLayer {
    type Service = PrintService<S>;

    fn layer(&self, service: S) -> Self::Service {
        PrintService {
            inner: service,
            name: self.name,
        }
    }
}

pub struct PrintPlugin;

impl<P, Op, S, L> Plugin<P, Op, S, L> for PrintPlugin
where
    Op: OperationShape,
{
    type Service = S;
    type Layer = Stack<L, PrintLayer>;

    fn map(&self, input: Operation<S, L>) -> Operation<Self::Service, Self::Layer> {
        input.layer(PrintLayer { name: Op::NAME })
    }
}
```

now becomes

```rust
pub struct PrintService<S> {
    inner: S,
    name: &'static str,
}

impl<R, S> Service<R> for PrintService<S>
where
    S: Service<R>,
{
    async fn call(&mut self, req: R) -> Self::Future {
        println!("Hi {}", self.name);
        self.inner.call(req)
    }
}

pub struct PrintPlugin;

impl<Service, Op, T> Plugin<Service, Operation, T> for PrintPlugin
where
    Op: OperationShape,
{
    type Output = PrintService<S>;

    fn apply(&self, inner: T) -> Self::Output {
        PrintService { inner, name: Op::ID.name() }
    }
}

impl HttpMarker for PrintPlugin { }
```

Alternatively, using the new `ServiceShape`, implemented on `Ser`:

```rust
impl<Service, Operation, T> Plugin<Service, Operation, T> for PrintPlugin
where
    Ser: ServiceShape,
{
    type Service = PrintService<S>;

    fn apply(&self, inner: T) -> Self::Service {
        PrintService { inner, name: Ser::ID.name() }
    }
}
```

A single `Plugin` can no longer apply a `tower::Layer` on HTTP requests/responses _and_ modelled structures at the same time (see middleware positions [C](https://awslabs.github.io/smithy-rs/design/server/middleware.html#c-operation-specific-http-middleware) and [D](https://awslabs.github.io/smithy-rs/design/server/middleware.html#d-operation-specific-model-middleware). Instead one `Plugin` must be specified for each and passed to the service builder constructor separately:

```rust
let app = PokemonService::builder_with_plugins(/* HTTP plugins */, /* model plugins */)
    /* setters */
    .build()
    .unwrap();
```

To better distinguish when a plugin runs and what it has access to, `Plugin`s now have to additionally implement the `HttpMarker` marker trait, the `ModelMarker` marker trait, or both:

- A HTTP plugin acts on the HTTP request before it is deserialized, and acts on the HTTP response after it is serialized.
- A model plugin acts on the modeled operation input after it is deserialized, and acts on the modeled operation output or the modeled operation error before it is serialized.

The motivation behind this change is to simplify the job of middleware authors, separate concerns, accomodate common cases better, and to improve composition internally.

Because `Plugin` is now closer to `tower::Layer` we have two canonical converters:

```rust
use aws_smithy_http_server::plugin::{PluginLayer, LayerPlugin};

// Convert from `Layer` to `Plugin` which applies uniformly across all operations
let layer = /* some layer */;
let plugin = PluginLayer(layer);

// Convert from `Plugin` to `Layer` for some fixed protocol and operation
let plugin = /* some plugin */;
let layer = LayerPlugin::new::<SomeProtocol, SomeOperation>(plugin);
```

## Removal of `PluginPipeline`

Since plugins now come in two flavors (those marked with `HttpMarker` and those marked with `ModelMarker`) that shouldn't be mixed in a collection of plugins, the primary way of concatenating plugins, `PluginPipeline` has been removed in favor of the `HttpPlugins` and `ModelPlugins` types, which eagerly check that whenever a plugin is pushed, it is of the expected type.

This worked before, but you wouldn't be able to do apply this collection of plugins anywhere; if you tried to, the compilation error messages would not be very helpful:

```rust
use aws_smithy_http_server::plugin::PluginPipeline;

let pipeline = PluginPipeline::new().push(http_plugin).push(model_plugin);
```

Now collections of plugins must contain plugins of the same flavor:

```rust
use aws_smithy_http_server::plugin::{HttpPlugins, ModelPlugins};

let http_plugins = HttpPlugins::new()
    .push(http_plugin)
    // .push(model_plugin) // This fails to compile with a helpful error message.
    .push(&http_and_model_plugin);
let model_plugins = ModelPlugins::new()
    .push(model_plugin)
    .push(&http_and_model_plugin);
```

In the above example, `&http_and_model_plugin` implements both `HttpMarker` and `ModelMarker`, so we can add it to both collections.

## Removal of `Operation`

The `aws_smithy_http_server::operation::Operation` structure has now been removed. Previously, there existed a `{operation_name}_operation` setter on the service builder, which accepted an `Operation`. This allowed users to

```rust
let operation /* : Operation<_, _> */ = GetPokemonSpecies::from_service(/* tower::Service */);

let app = PokemonService::builder_without_plugins()
    .get_pokemon_species_operation(operation)
    /* other setters */
    .build()
    .unwrap();
```

to set an operation with a `tower::Service`, and

```rust
let operation /* : Operation<_, _> */ = GetPokemonSpecies::from_service(/* tower::Service */).layer(/* layer */);
let operation /* : Operation<_, _> */ = GetPokemonSpecies::from_handler(/* closure */).layer(/* layer */);

let app = PokemonService::builder_without_plugins()
    .get_pokemon_species_operation(operation)
    /* other setters */
    .build()
    .unwrap();
```

to add a `tower::Layer` (acting on HTTP requests/responses post-routing) to a single operation.

We have seen little adoption of this API and for this reason we have opted instead to introduce a new setter, accepting a `tower::Service`, on the service builder:

```rust
let app = PokemonService::builder_without_plugins()
    .get_pokemon_species_service(/* tower::Service */)
    /* other setters */
    .build()
    .unwrap();
```

Applying a `tower::Layer` to a _subset_ of operations is should now be done through the `Plugin` API via `filter_by_operation_id`

```rust
use aws_smithy_http_server::plugin::{PluginLayer, filter_by_operation_name, IdentityPlugin};

let plugin = PluginLayer(/* layer */);
let scoped_plugin = filter_by_operation_name(plugin, |id| id == GetPokemonSpecies::ID);

let app = PokemonService::builder_with_plugins(scoped_plugin, IdentityPlugin)
    .get_pokemon_species(/* handler */)
    /* other setters */
    .build()
    .unwrap();
```

or the new `Scoped` `Plugin` introduced below.

# Addition of `Scoped`

Currently, users can selectively apply a `Plugin` via the `filter_by_operation_id` function

```rust
use aws_smithy_http_server::plugin::filter_by_operation_id;
// Only apply `plugin` to `CheckHealth` and `GetStorage` operation
let filtered_plugin = filter_by_operation_id(plugin, |name| name == CheckHealth::ID || name == GetStorage::ID);
```

In addition to this, we now provide `Scoped`, which selectively applies a `Plugin` at _compiletime_. Users should prefer this to `filter_by_operation_id` when applicable.

```rust
use aws_smithy_http_server::plugin::Scoped;
use pokemon_service_server_sdk::scoped;

scope! {
    /// Includes only the `CheckHealth` and `GetStorage` operation.
    struct SomeScope {
        includes: [CheckHealth, GetStorage]
    }
}
let scoped_plugin = Scoped::new::<SomeScope>(plugin);
```

let filtered = filter_by_operation_id(plugin, |name| name != CheckHealth::NAME);
