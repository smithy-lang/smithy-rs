<details>
<summary>Breaking change in how event stream signing works (click to expand more details)</summary>

This change will only impact you if you are wiring up their own event stream signing/authentication scheme. If you're using `aws-sig-auth` to use AWS SigV4 event stream signing, then this change will **not** impact you.

Previously, event stream signing was configured at codegen time by placing a `new_event_stream_signer` method on the `Config`. This function was called at serialization time to connect the signer to the streaming body. Now, instead, a special `DeferredSigner` is wired up at serialization time that relies on a signing implementation to be sent on a channel by the HTTP request signer. To do this, a `DeferredSignerSender` must be pulled out of the property bag, and its `send()` method called with the desired event stream signing implementation.

See the changes in https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/pull/2671 for an example of how this was done for SigV4.

message = """`ShapeId` is the new structure used to represent a shape, with its absolute name, namespace and name.
`OperationExtension`'s members are replaced by the `ShapeId` and operations' names are now replced by a `ShapeId`.

Before you had an operation and an absolute name as its `NAME` member. You could apply a plugin only to some selected operation:

```
filter_by_operation_name(plugin, |name| name != Op::NAME);
```

Your new filter selects on an operation's absolute name, namespace or name.

```
filter_by_operation_id(plugin, |id| id.name() != Op::NAME.name());
```

The above filter is applied to an operation's name, the one you use to specify the operation in the Smithy model.

You can filter all operations in a namespace or absolute name:

```
filter_by_operation_id(plugin, |id| id.namespace() != "namespace");
filter_by_operation_id(plugin, |id| id.absolute() != "namespace#name");
