message = """
Service configs are now generated with new accessors for:
- `Config::retry_config()` - Returns a reference to the inner retry configuration.
- `Config::timeout_config()` - Returns a reference to the inner timeout configuration.
- `Config::sleep_impl()` - Returns a clone of the inner async sleep implementation.

Previously, these were only accessible through `SdkConfig`.

message = """
Previously, the config customizations that added functionality related to retry configs, timeout configs, and the 
async sleep impl were defined in the smithy codegen module but were being loaded in the AWS codegen module. They
have now been updated to be loaded during smithy codegen. The affected classes are all defined in the
`software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy.customizations` module of smithy codegen.` This change does not affect
the generated code.

These classes have been removed:
- `RetryConfigDecorator`
- `SleepImplDecorator`
- `TimeoutConfigDecorator`

These classes have been renamed:
- `RetryConfigProviderConfig` is now `RetryConfigProviderCustomization`
- `PubUseRetryConfig` is now `PubUseRetryConfigGenerator`
- `SleepImplProviderConfig` is now `SleepImplProviderCustomization`
- `TimeoutConfigProviderConfig` is now `TimeoutConfigProviderCustomization`
