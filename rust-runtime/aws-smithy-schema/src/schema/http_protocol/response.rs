//! The composite response deserializer that makes a REST protocol the sole owner of
//! response deserialization.
//!
//! A REST protocol returns one of these instead of a bare body deserializer. It reads
//! `@httpHeader`, `@httpPrefixHeaders`, `@httpResponseCode`, and `@httpPayload` members from
//! the HTTP message itself, delegates everything else to the protocol's body codec, and
//! drives the same generated member-index consumer either way. Body-only protocols (RPC,
//! Query, CBOR) keep returning their codec's deserializer and therefore ignore HTTP binding
//! traits, as the SEP requires.
//!
//! # Where the decisions live
//!
//! Which members are bound comes from the const-derived routing word on the structure schema,
//! so the common case visits only bound members rather than scanning. How each bound value
//! parses lives in [`super::bound_value`]. This module is the router between them, plus the
//! `NonUtf8HeaderHandling` policy and the body/transport precedence rule.
