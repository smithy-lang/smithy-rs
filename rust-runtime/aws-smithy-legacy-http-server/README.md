# aws-smithy-legacy-http-server

**This is a legacy crate that provides support for `http@0.x` and `hyper@0.x`.**

Server libraries for smithy-rs generated servers.

## Usage

This crate is used when generating server SDKs without the `http-1x` codegen flag. For new projects, prefer using `aws-smithy-http-server` which supports `http@1.x` and `hyper@1.x`.

This crate is part of the [AWS SDK for Rust](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-sdk-rust/) and the [smithy-rs](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs) code generator. In most cases, it should not be used directly.
